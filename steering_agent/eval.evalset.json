A list of your requirements, their validation status, findings, and traceability links.\n\nRegarding \"maintaining traceability,\" this is an ongoing process. It involves:\n*   **Establishing Links:** Creating and recording the relationships between different levels of requirements (e.g., stakeholder needs to system requirements, system requirements to subsystem requirements) and between requirements and other project artifacts (e.g., design documents, test cases, analysis reports).\n*   **Managing Change:** When a requirement changes, traceability helps identify all affected items, ensuring that impacts are understood and managed.\n*   **Verification and Validation:** Traceability ensures that all requirements are covered by design elements and verified by tests.\n*   **Impact Analysis:** If a test fails or a design issue is found, traceability helps identify the originating requirement(s).\n\nTo effectively maintain traceability, you would typically use a requirements management tool (like IBM DOORS, which we've already interacted with) or a dedicated traceability matrix. The `VALRPT-REQ-001` and `TRACE-REQ-001` IDs we discussed can be used for requirements specifically governing how validation reporting and traceability themselves should be performed within your project.\n\nWhat would you like to do next? For instance, would you like to populate the validation report with specific data, or delve deeper into setting up traceability for a set of requirements?"

Executive Summary\n\nThis report summarizes the validation status of aerospace engineering requirements for the [Project SkyWing - Example]. A total of **4** requirements were analyzed against the provided response documents.\n\n*   **Overall Coverage:**\n    *   **Fully Covered:** 1 (25%)\n    *   **Issues Identified:** 3 (75%)\n        *   Ambiguous: 1\n        *   Misaligned: 1\n        *   Not Covered (Missing): 1\n*   **Key Findings:** Significant gaps exist in requirement coverage, particularly regarding missing implementation details and misalignments with specified performance targets. Ambiguity in one requirement needs immediate clarification to ensure correct implementation.\n*   **Action Required:** Engineering teams are advised to prioritize addressing the 'Not Covered' and 'Misaligned' requirements. Clarification for 'Ambiguous' requirements should also be sought promptly.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

The scope of \"ARINC standards\" used is unclear. | Clarify with the avionics team if ARINC 661 is specifically implemented. Update `AID_Avionics_Suite_v0.9.pdf`, Section 4.2 to explicitly state ARINC 661 compliance if applicable. | High     |\n| **SRS_REQ_003**         | The navigation system shall provide position accuracy of +/- 5 meters (95% CEP).       | `TR_NAV_System_Test_RevA.xlsx`, Test Case TC_NAV_005                   | **Misaligned**           | Test report shows navigation accuracy measured at +/- 10 meters (95% CEP), which does not meet the +/- 5 meters requirement.                          | Investigate the cause of the accuracy discrepancy. Options: 1. Re-calibrate/improve navigation system. 2. If +/- 5m is unachievable, submit a formal deviation request with justification. | High     |\n| **SRS_REQ_004**         | The aircraft shall include an Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) compliant with TSO-C126. | *Not Found*                                                            | **Not Covered (Missing)** | No mention of an ELT or its compliance in any reviewed response documents (`DDS_SkyWing_Airframe_v1.0.docx`, `AID_Avionics_Suite_v0.9.pdf`).       | 1. Add ELT requirement to the system design. 2. Select a TSO-C126 compliant ELT. 3. Incorporate ELT into aircraft design specifications and relevant interface documents.           | High     |\n| **SRS_REQ_005**         | The cockpit displays shall provide a minimum refresh rate of 60 Hz.                      | `AID_Avionics_Suite_v0.9.pdf`, Section 5.3.2 \"Display Characteristics\" | **Partially Covered**    | Document states \"Display refresh rate is optimized for pilot readability,\" but does not explicitly state 60 Hz or provide a numerical value.          | Update `AID_Avionics_Suite_v0.9.pdf` Section 5.3.2 to specify the exact minimum refresh rate achieved. Verify it meets or exceeds 60 Hz.                                   | Medium   |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Traceability\n\nTraceability between source requirements and response documents is maintained within the **Validation Summary** table (Section 3). Each source requirement is linked to the specific document and section (where available) that addresses it, or marked as 'Not Found' if no corresponding coverage exists.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Conclusion and Next Steps\n\nThis validation exercise has identified several critical areas requiring attention. The engineering team should:\n\n1.  **Address High Priority Items:** Immediately focus on remediating 'Not Covered', 'Misaligned', and 'Ambiguous' requirements as detailed in Section 3.\n2.  **Update Documentation:** Ensure all response documents are updated to accurately reflect the implemented design and its compliance with source requirements post-remediation.\n3.  **Conduct Follow-up Validation:** A follow-up validation will be necessary once remediation actions are completed to verify closure of identified gaps.\n\nFor any clarifications regarding this report, please contact the ReqPilot administrator or the Validation Lead.\n\n---\n**End of Report**\n```"
