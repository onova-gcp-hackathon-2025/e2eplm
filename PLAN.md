# Aerospace Requirements Validation Hackathon Plan

## Company Name: Airquire

This name evokes both "air" (aerospace) and "acquire" (gathering/validating requirements), aligning with our mission to elevate requirements management.

## Application Name: ReqPilot

Our application, ReqPilot, guides requirements validation and compliance, accelerating aerospace engineering workflows.

## Elevator Pitch Template

"ReqPilot by Airquire is revolutionizing aerospace engineering compliance by automating requirements validation. Our AI-powered platform ingests complex technical specifications and engineering responses, then uses advanced natural language understanding to identify gaps, misalignments, and ambiguities. Unlike traditional manual processes that take weeks, ReqPilot delivers comprehensive validation in minutes, reducing rework by 60% and accelerating development cycles. With Airquire, aerospace engineers can focus on innovation rather than documentation."

## Figma Mock Screens
1. Dashboard - Overview of requirements validation status
2. Document Upload - Interface for ingesting DOORS exports and PDF responses
3. Requirements Explorer - Hierarchical view of all requirements
4. Validation Report - Gap analysis with visual indicators
5. Requirement Detail - Side-by-side comparison of source and response
6. Remediation Suggestions - AI-generated fixes for identified gaps

## Where to Start?

1. **Begin with the architecture**: Create a simple diagram of your system components to guide development
2. **Set up infrastructure**: Initialize your GCP project and configure ADK environment
3. **Start Figma mockups early**: Create basic UI flows while developing backend
4. **Focus on core value proposition**: Prioritize the requirements extraction and validation components
5. **Generate synthetic data**: Create realistic aerospace requirements to demonstrate your solution
