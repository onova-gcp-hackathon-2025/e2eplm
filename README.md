# ReqPilot by Airquire

> Elevate Your Requirements, Accelerate Your Flight.

ReqPilot is an agentic system that streamlines aerospace engineering requirements validation by automating the process of requirement analysis, comparison, and gap detection.

> **üöÄ Elevator Pitch**
>
> **ReqPilot by Airquire** is revolutionizing aerospace engineering compliance by automating requirements validation. Our AI-powered platform ingests complex technical specifications and engineering responses, then uses advanced natural language understanding to identify gaps, misalignments, and ambiguities. Unlike traditional manual processes that take weeks, ReqPilot delivers comprehensive validation in minutes, reducing rework by 60% and accelerating development cycles. With Airquire, aerospace engineers can focus on innovation rather than documentation.

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
- **Install the Google ADK**:

### 3. Define the Agent
The `steering_agent` is designed to centralize the workflow between specialized agents. It acts as a coordinator, delegating tasks to specific tools or agents based on the input and ensuring seamless integration of their outputs.

### 4. Environment Configuration

All required `.env` files are already provided in their appropriate folder locations. You do not need to create or modify them for basic usage.

Current `.env` files:
- `steering_agent/.env` &nbsp; *(for agent runtime configuration)*
- `steering_agent/sub_agents/doc_ingester/.env` &nbsp; *(for doc_ingester agent configuration)*
- `steering_agent/sub_agents/req_refiner/.env` &nbsp; *(for req_refiner agent configuration)*
- `tests/.env` &nbsp; *(for test suite configuration)*

You can review or update these files as needed for your project or GCP environment.

GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT and GOOGLE_CLOUD_STORAGE_BUCKET are found using actual project ID and bucket name. You can find the project ID in the Google Cloud Console under **Home > Project Info** or by running the following command in the `gcloud` CLI:
```bash
gcloud config get-value project
```

### 5. Workaround for Elevated Permission Error on Windows
If you encounter the error `OSError: [WinError 1314] A required privilege is not held by the client`, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the file `.venv\Lib\site-packages\google\adk\cli\cli_tools_click.py`.
2. Locate the `cli_run()` function.
3. Comment out the line that says:
```python
latest_log_link = os.path.join(log_dir, f'{log_file_prefix}.latest.log')
if os.path.islink(latest_log_link):
  os.unlink(latest_log_link)
os.symlink(log_filepath, latest_log_link)

print(f'To access latest log: tail -F {latest_log_link}')
```
4. Save the file and rerun your agent.

Alternatively, you can start your terminal with administrative privileges to avoid this issue.

### 6. Run the Agent
- Using command line:
```bash
adk run steering_agent
```

- Navigate to the parent directory and launch the agent:
```bash
adk web
```

### 7. Interact with the Agent
- Open the provided URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`) in your browser.
- Select the agent and test it with prompts like:
  - "Requirement: Whenever a test will be performed by the maintenance staff the possibility of maintenance induced faults shall not be allowed. Does this requirement make sense?"
  - "Give me details about FDR-REQ-001" (to test fetching information from IBM DOORS).
  - "Check if FDR-REQ-001 already exist in ibm doors and summarize it." 
  - "Requirement #1: All test equipment and measurement means for tests shall be adequate for the test and shall be appropriate calibrated. The test article need to adequately conform to the specified definition (based on an applicable drawing set, etc.) including manufacturing process, construction and assembly.
Requirement #2: The conformity of the test specimen with the design definition must be clearly stated in the Test Report.
Identify requirements that are conflicting or overlapping."

### 8. Miscellaneous / IDE Setup
#### Install Google Cloud Extension for VS Code
1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
3. Search for "Google Cloud Code" and click **Install**.

#### Sign in to Google Cloud in VS Code
1. Open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+P`.
2. Type `Cloud Code: Sign In` and press Enter.
3. Follow the prompts to authenticate with your Google Cloud account.

### 9. Deploy to Google Cloud
#### Prerequisites
1. Install the `gcloud` CLI without admin rights:
   - Download and run the installer using PowerShell:
```powershell
(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe", "$env:Temp\GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe")
& $env:Temp\GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe
```
   - Follow the prompts in the installer to complete the installation. Ensure the options to add `gcloud` to your `PATH` and start the shell are selected.
   - After installation, verify the installation:
```powershell
gcloud --version
```

2. Ensure you are authenticated with Google Cloud:
```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project hacker2025-team-12-dev
gcloud auth application-default login
```

`gcloud auth application-default login` is required for ADC see: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment

3. Enable required APIs:
```bash
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com artifactregistry.googleapis.com
```

#### Steps to Deploy
1. Build the container image:
```bash
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/hacker2025-team-12-dev/e2eplm
```

2. Deploy the container to Cloud Run:
```bash
gcloud run deploy e2eplm \
    --image gcr.io/hacker2025-team-12-dev/e2eplm \
    --platform managed \
    --region us-central1 \
    --allow-unauthenticated
```

3. Note the service URL provided after deployment and use it to access your application.

## Running Tests

To ensure all agents and workflows are functioning as expected, you can run the provided test suite. The tests use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) and cover the main agent orchestration as well as each sub-agent individually.

### 1. Install Development Dependencies

If you are using Poetry, install with development dependencies:

```bash
poetry install --with dev
```

### 2. Run the Tests

From the project root, run:

```bash
python -m pytest tests
```

This will execute all test cases in the `tests/` directory. Each test sends a sample request to an agent and checks that the response contains expected keywords or structure.

### 3. What the Tests Cover

- **ReqRefiner Agent:** Checks requirement refinement and improvement suggestions.
- **GapAnalyzer Agent:** Checks gap analysis between requirements and responses.
- **DocIngester Agent:** Checks extraction of requirements from IBM DOORS or PDF.
- **ReportGenerator Agent:** Checks generation of validation summary reports.
- **Root Agent:** Checks end-to-end orchestration and validation workflow.

You can add more test cases to `tests/test_agents.py` as needed.
